\chapter{Preface}

I have a bad memory that I can hardly remember anything.

To get rid of it, I tried many ways of help myself memorizing things and pushing myself to the frontier of physics. Finally, I decided to collect some of my notes together and established this project on github.\url{http://cosmologytaskforce.github.com/CosmologyResearchSurvivingManual}

This is only a draft handbook for myself in principal. However, I believe everyone need a handbook of his/her area and my version of handbook might be helpful for some people working on similiar things with mine.

This book can never not be delivered formally because I borrowed many resources in this book. Here I list the most important of them here.

\begin{itemize}
\item
In the part of physics, I just take the source file of a note on GRE Physics subject test written by Lin Cong and typeset by Duncan Watts and rearranged the sections.\url{http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~physics/?q=node/13};\url{http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~physics/files/GRE\%20notes.tex} Then I did modifications based on it.
He said in his notes everyone is welcome to typeset and improve his notes but if you are going to use this document commercially you need to contact him first.
\end{itemize}
