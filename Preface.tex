\chapter{Preface}

I have a bad memory. So bad that I can hardly remember anything.

I tried many ways of pushing myself to the frontier of physics. That bad memory really pissed me off. So I decided to borrow the power of paper and computer.

This is only a draft handbook for myself in principal. However, I believe everyone need a handbook of his/her area and my version of handbook might be helpful for some people working on similiar things with mine.
