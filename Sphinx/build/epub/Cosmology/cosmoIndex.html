<li>Photons have only two DoF because it is mass 0. Same reason can apply to gluon. But according to symmetry, there are 8 kinds of gluons.</li>
<li>W bosons carry charges. This is where the 2 come from.</li>
<li>Electrons and quarks have antiparticles. So there DoF will be doubled after counting the spin.</li>

<h3>7.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion and Temperature</h3>
<p>We can see that the heaviest particle is top quark with a mass of <span class="math">\(m_t = 170 \mathrm{GeV}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="temperature-greater-than-mass-of-top-quark">
<h4>7.1.1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature Greater Than Mass of Top Quark</h4>
<p>If temperature of the universe <span class="math">\(T \gg m_t\)</span>, all particles should be in relativistic regime and the decay (annihilation) and inverse decay (inverse annihilation) are in equilibrium so all particles contribute to the thermal quantities in a relativistic way.</p>
<div class="math">
\[g_B = 28\]\[g_F = 90\]</div>
<p>Then</p>
<div class="math">
\[g _ * = g_B + \frac{7}{8} g _ F = 106.75\]</div>
<p>For convinience, define the following reduced Planck mass</p>
<div class="math">
\[8\pi G = \frac{1}{M _ p ^2}\]</div>
<p>And it&#8217;s good to know its value, which is <span class="math">\(2.4\times 10^{18} \mathrm{GeV}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We would like to know the relation between expansion and temperature. We already know that the energy density is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\rho = g _ * \frac{\pi^2}{30} T^4\]</div>
<p>So the expansion is</p>
<div class="math">
\[H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho = 106.75 \times \frac{\pi^2}{30} \frac{T^4}{3 M_p^2}\]</div>
<p>So Hubble function is</p>
<div class="math">
\[H \approx 3 \frac{T^2}{M_p}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="temperature-down-to-mass-of-a-particle">
<h4>7.1.1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature Down to Mass of A Particle</h4>
<p>As temperature drops down, particle dacay (annihilation) will be greater than its inverse which is suppressed by Boltzmann factor <span class="math">\(\exp (-m/T)\)</span>. The decay rate is so quick that the particle will almost dispear before the universe expand a lot.</p>
<p>So when the temperature drops below the mass of a particle, it won&#8217;t contribute to the energy density. Their DoF will just dispear.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math">\(T~\mathrm{MeV}\)</span>, Higgs and W and Z will decay and quarks are combined with gluons. So we only have <strong>photons, electrons, neutrinos</strong> as elementary particles, that is <span class="math">\(g_* = 10.75\)</span>.</p>

<h2>7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Parameters</h2>
<p>Why is Cosmology Dedicated to Finding Two Parameters Before 90&#8217;s</p>
<p>Basically, the cosmology before the 90&#8217;s have only two tasks. The first one is to find out the Hubble constant, while the second one is looking for the deceleration parameter.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t rush to define what Hubble constant and deceleration parameter are, but have a look at what observations do at that time.</p>
<div class="section" id="observations">
<h3>7.1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations</h3>
<p>Astronomers are really good at measuring distances. They have infinite tricky ways to find out some distance.</p>
<div class="section" id="luminosity-distance">
<h4>7.1.2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminosity Distance</h4>
<div class="section" id="luminosity-distance-from-observation">
<h5>7.1.2.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminosity Distance from Observation</h5>
<p>We can find out how bright a star is by observation. One way to represent the brightness is to use the energy crossed per unit area per unit time at the observer, because this is what our eyes do.</p>
<p>This quantity is related to how much energy was emitted at the star, how far we are from the star. The more energy the star emitted, the brighter it look like. The nearer the star is, the brighter it is. Just like what we feel like with a candle.</p>
<p>This schematic picture shows that energy spread out on a surface because the total energy is conserved. Isotropic energy flux through the same solid angle at different radius must be the same.</p>
<img alt="From Wikipedia: Inverse equare law, CC." class="align-center" src="../_images/InverseSquareLaw.png" />
<p>Through a very simple calculation, it is as simple as</p>
<div class="math">
\[L_0 = \frac{ L }{ 4\pi r^2 } .\]</div>
<p>We are dealing with Cosmology now. The space-time manifold should be a great concern. The luminosity turns out to be</p>
<div class="math">
\[L_0 = \frac{L_\mathrm{abs} }{4\pi d^2} \frac{1}{1+z} \frac{1}{1+z} .\]</div>
<p>Here d is the physical distance between the star and the observer. L is the absolute luminosity of the star, which stands for the power of the star. z is the redshift of the star.</p>
<p>The first <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{1+z}\)</span> term comes from the fact that the energy of each photon decrease due to expansion of the universe, while the second is the result that the rate of photons arrived at the observer is less.</p>
<p>We are happy to define</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = d (1+z) ,\]</div>
<p>then the luminosity becomes simpler,</p>
<div class="math">
\[L_0 = \frac{L_{\mathrm {abs}}}{4\pi d_L^2} .\]</div>
<p>Now we come back to have a look at this luminosity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We can measure how much energy is passing through a unit area at a unit time, which means <strong>we can determine this luminosity directly from observations</strong>.</li>
<li>We can <strong>predict the absolute luminosity</strong> from a star evolution model.</li>
<li>The <span class="math">\(d_L = d (1+z)\)</span> is only valid for a flat universe, with curvature term <span class="math">\(K=0\)</span> in Friedmann equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we can find out this so called luminosity distance</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = \frac{  L_{\mathrm {abs}} }{ 4\pi L_0 }\]</div>
<p>from some data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="luminosity-distance-from-theory">
<h5>7.1.2.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminosity Distance from Theory</h5>
<p>We don&#8217;t just do the observation for the luminosity distance itself.
We observe to test theories.</p>
<p>What is this distance in theory?</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = d (1+z)\]</div>
<p>Wait, didn&#8217;t we just mention that this is only valid for a flat universe? So we just do some extension.</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = R(d) (1+z)\]</div>
<p>where R(d) is a function of d and can be determined through geometry,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spherical: <span class="math">\(4\pi \sin^2 d\)</span> ,</li>
<li>Flat: <span class="math">\(4\pi d\)</span> ,</li>
<li>Hyperbolic: <span class="math">\(4\pi \sinh^2 d\)</span> .</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nearby-objects">
<h5>7.1.2.1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby Objects</h5>
<p>For nearby objects, we can always use flat geometry and use Taylor expansion at current time for a(t).</p>
<p>Luminosity distance is</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = d (1+z) = r a(t) (1+z) ,\]</div>
<p>where r is the comoving distance and a(t) is the scale factor at time t.</p>
<p>We know</p>
<div class="math">
\[r = \int_t^{t_0} \frac{1}{a(t')} \mathrm d t' .\]</div>
<p>So we are happy to use Taylor expansion around <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(a(t)\)</span>, and keep only up to the second order of time. And do some substitution with</p>
<div class="math">
\[H_0 = \dot a(t_0)/a(t_0)\]\[q_0=\ddot a (t_0) / a(t_0)\]</div>
<p>We then do the same thing on redshift</p>
<div class="math">
\[z=a(t_0)/a(t) - 1 .\]</div>
<p>Finally, we can find out the relation <span class="math">\(r(z)\)</span>, which leads us to the result we need, <span class="math">\(d_L(z) = H_0^{-1} (z - \frac12 (1+q_0) z^2)\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">For very near objects (not as near as our sun of course),</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_L = H_0^{-1}z .\]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is a model independent observation and derivation. We can draw a line to represent the case when deceleration parameter is zero, lines higher than this stands for a accelerating universe while lower region show a decelerating universe.</strong></p>
<img alt="Luminosity Distance VS Redshift" src="../_images/LuminosityDistanceVSRedshift.png" />
<p>We can show that for a vacuum energy dominated universe, the line would go up and for a matter dominated universe, it would below the zero deceleration line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comment">
<h5>7.1.2.1.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comment</h5>
<p>In this model independent method, the only two parameters occur are Hubble constant <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> and deceleration parameter <span class="math">\(q_0\)</span> .</p>

<h4>7.1.2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angular Diameter Distance</h4>
<div class="section" id="observation">
<h5>7.1.2.1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation</h5>
<p>Angular diameter distance is really useful if we have some standard ruler. Now assume we have a ruler d, we can find out the angle between the two ends of the ruler, by some kind of measurement.</p>
<img alt="Angular Diameter Diatance" src="../_images/AngularDiaFormula.jpg" />
<p>At the same time, we can use magic of math</p>
<div class="math">
\[\theta = d/D .\]</div>
<p>Now as we already find out what <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is by a measurement, and we said about the d is a standard ruler, which means we know the length of it very well. Then we can find out the distance <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, which is the distance between us and the standard ruler.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theory">
<h5>7.1.2.1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theory</h5>
<p>We can find out this kind of distance, which we will denote it as <span class="math">\(d_A\)</span> from now on. What is it for?</p>
<p>A angular diameter distance is the physical distance between us and the standard ruler,</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_A = a(t)r .\]</div>
<p>We can use the same trick we used in luminosity distance calculations, and it is easy to find that</p>
<div class="math">
\[d_A = H_0^{-1} (z - \frac{1}{2} (3 + q_0)z^2 ) .\]</div>
<p>Again, the observation is related to only two parameters, Hubble constant <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> and deceleration parameter <span class="math">\(q_0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standard-rulers">
<h5>7.1.2.1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Rulers</h5>
<p>It is hard to imagine that we really have some standard rulers. In fact, we do. They are</p>

<div class="section" id="galaxy-number-count">
<h4>7.1.2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galaxy Number Count</h4>
<p>Now we can see anything that is only (simply) related to physical or comoving distance can be determined by this trick. The result is that only two cosmological parameters would come in our equation as long as we keep only upper to order two of redshift.</p>
<p>Here another example is the galaxy number count.</p>
