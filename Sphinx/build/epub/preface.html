<h1>Whatever</h1>
<p>I alway believe that making things open to everyone is one of the most powerful things that drive the world forward. So I DO think open source and open data, even open education are reforming the world.</p>
<p>This was a draft handbook for myself when I was studying in Fudan University. At that time, I learned how to use LaTeX and I was so exciting. So I thought I should start writing something using LaTeX since it&#8217;s so beautiful. Well, the bad thing is, I just randomly wrote down my notes on some specific topics.</p>
<p>I was so greedy back then. I was trying to build up my own framework of physics by writing notes here. It never did the work by the way. Then I realized a framework should be somethng organized much better than this one. (I should draw a map of physics.)</p>
<p>Though these notes didn&#8217;t help me building up my framework of phyiscs, I learn an important lesson. A physicist should build up his/her own style: the way to think, the way to solve problems, the way to check answers, the way to write, etc.  (I just want to create a new word for his/her, hir or hes.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I got frastrated and gave up the effort to utilize it as a framework-building thing. However I won&#8217;t just dump these notes. As I have more and more to add, I think I&#8217;ll just let it be my notebook, which, of course, is open source and accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Yes. Use the source. Keep the source open.</p>
