Preface

This is only a draft handbook for myself. However, I think it might be helpful for some people working on similiar things.

I started this manual when I just started my graduate study in China. At that time, I learned how to use LaTeX and I was so exciting. So I think I should start write something using LaTeX since it's so beautiful.

Finally I decided to write down my notes on some specific topics. Later, I just started establishing my own framwork of Physics. As long as I decided to cover more topics, I changed the name of my project to Research Survival Manual.
