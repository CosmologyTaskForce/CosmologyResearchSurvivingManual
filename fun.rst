Here are some interesting physics related problems.




Quantum
=====================


.. admonition:: Why Rutherford was wrong about the atom model?
   :class: note
   :name: rutherford-atom

   Link to this: `rutherford-atom <#rutherford-atom>`_ 

   A Rutherford atom model is the combination of protons and electrons to give us a neutral nucleus.

   Question 1: What is the energy of the electron if we confine it inside the nucleus? Consider only the kinetic energy due to uncertainty principle is enough to construct a contradiction.

   Question 2: From the point of view of nuclear magnetic moment, the electron magnetic moment is way to large. Measurement tells us that nuclei usually have nuclear magnetic moment :math:`-3\mu_N` to :math:`10\mu_N` where :math:`\mu_N=e\hbar/2m_p` and :math:`m_p` is the mass of proton. 

   Hint: The magnetic moment is of the magnitude :math:`e\hbar/2m_x`. 


Relativity
========================


.. admonition:: Blazers in astrophysics
   :class: note
   :name: blazers

   Link to this: `Blazers <#blazers>`_

   Blazers has a very large apparant velocity, which is usually much larger than speed of light, eg, 34c.

   This problem is very nicely explained on this page: `Apparent Superluminal Velocity of Galaxies <http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/Superluminal/superluminal.html>`_ .

      This is taken form the link metioned above. We measure the distance at 1 Jan then at 1 Feb. The apparent velocity would be the travelled distance divided by 1 month. However, the first measurement only measured the light from a place that is :math:`1+d/c` further than the second spot due the the fact that light travels at a finite speed. So the distance we measured is larger than the actual distance at 1 Jan and 1 Feb. Thus leading to a apparent larger velocity and this velocity can exceed the limit of light speed.
