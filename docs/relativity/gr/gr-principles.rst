Tidal Force and Equivalence Principle
---------------------------------------


We can imagine from the Einstein's elavator thought experiment that we could not tell whether we are in a inertial frame or free falling frame by measuring forces. This is generalized to the weak equilvalence principle.

   :class: note

   Uniform gravitational field are equivalent to frames that are accelerating uniformly.


On the other hand, we know that tidal force in the frame work of Newtonian gravity can be derived by finding the second order derivative of the displacement difference between two nearby objects. A free falling in non-uniform gravitation is distinguishable from inertial frame because we can measure the tidal force.

However, the free falling frame is no different than inertial frame **if the two object are close enough** since the comoving equipment we are using to measure the tidal effect could not tell the tidal effect.

The weak equivalence principle seems to work in limited circumstances. A stronger version is called the Einstein's equivalence principle which states that all physics are the same in a local spacetime. The word "same" means the equations have the same form thus requires tensor equations.
