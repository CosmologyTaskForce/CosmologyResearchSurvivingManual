Tidal Force and Equivalence Principle
---------------------------------------

Tidal force in the frame work of Newtonian gravity can be derived by finding the second order derivative of the displacement difference between two nearby objects.

The Einstein's equivalence principle means that the free falling frame is no different than inertial frame if the two object are close enough and the comoving equipment we are using to measure the tidal effect could not tell the effect.
