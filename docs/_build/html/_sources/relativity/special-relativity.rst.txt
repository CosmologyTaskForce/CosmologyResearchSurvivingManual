.. admonition:: Notations
   :class: toggle

   We use abstract index notation for most cases. A tensor with latin indices is an abstract tensor which tells us the rank of it but has no intention to indicate the components or basis.




We talk about transformations all the time in physics. For space and time, we also have the transformations from one reference frame to another, which plays the key role of our theories. Newtonian mechanics transform each space and time coordinates independently in translations. This idea was simply a extrapolation of our daily life experience that translations only change space coordinates accordingly, i.e.,

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   t'\\
   x'
   \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
   -v & 1
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   t\\
   x
   \end{pmatrix}

for the two reference systems described in :numref:`galilean-transformation`. This transformation matrix is neither symmetric nor Hermitian. It is ugly and unexpected. Why is time special and is not related to other coordinates?

As we think of this description, we would expect a most general transformation of coordinates for translation that involves all the coordinates, even for time.


.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   t' \\
   x'\\
   y'\\
   z'
   \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
   L_{11} & L_{12} & L_{13} & L_{14}\\
   L_{21} & L_{22} & L_{23} & L_{24}\\
   L_{31} & L_{32} & L_{33} & L_{34}\\
   L_{41} & L_{42} & L_{43} & L_{44}
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   t \\
   x\\
   y\\
   z
   \end{pmatrix}.


How to determine this transformation matrix :math:`\mathbf L`? Geometrically, we should conserve length since it's a scalar, which is

.. math::
   \eta^a_b x^a x^b,
   :label: eq-sr-calculate-interval

where :math:`\eta_{ab}` is the metric. More specifically,

.. math::
   \eta^a_b (L^a_cx^c )(L^b_d x^d ) = \eta^a_b x^a x^b.

In order to derive special relativity, we have to deterimin this metric :math:`\eta_{ab}`.

Physically or historically, we should preserve Maxwell's equation, since it has been proved to be true in different reference frames.

What people found is that the geometry is hyperbolic geometry, hence the metric is Minkowskian.


The Postulates, Spacetime Diagram, and Metric
=====================================================================


Special relativity was developed out of two postulates [Schutz2009]_

1. Princple of relativity (Galileo),
2. Universality of speed of light (Einstein).

Using these two postulates, where the first key definition is interval of events squared

.. math::
   \Delta s^2,

we can derive basically all the relations we need. Some other intuitions will also be applied to the derivations.


Using a spacetime diagram, we can prove that this is invariant under transformation of frames [Schutz2009]_.

.. admonition:: Hyperbolic Space
   :class: note

   If anyone realizes that spacetime is in fact hyperbolic space by looking at the expression of intervals :math:`\Delta s^2`, the transformation is determined.


As we know the invariant quantity of the physical laws, the transformation of vectors can be found out of it, which is basically a rotation in hyperbolic space.



Metric Conventions
==============================


The metric in Eq. :eq:`eq-sr-calculate-interval` is 'derived' from the interval.

To write it down, there are different convention. We choose the signature :math:`+2` metric in special relativity

.. math::
   \eta_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}
	-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
   \end{pmatrix}.


In most cases, we use natural unit :math:`c=1`.


.. admonition:: d'Alembert operator
   :class: toggle

   d'Alembert operator, or wave operator, is the Lapace operator in Minkowski space. [1]_

   .. math::
      \Box \equiv \partial _ \mu\partial^\nu = \eta _{\mu\nu}\partial^\mu \partial^\nu


   In the usual {t,x,y,z} natural orthonormal basis,

   .. math::
      \Box & = -\partial_t^2+\partial_x^2+\partial_y^2+\partial_z^2 \\
      & = -\partial_t^2+\Delta^2 \\
      & = -\partial_t^2+\nabla



   On wiki [2]_ , they give some applications to it.
   	* klein-Gordon equation
   	  :math:`(\Box+m^2)\phi=0`
   	* wave equation for electromagnetic field in vacuum:
   	  For the electromagnetic four-potential $\Box A^\mu=0$\footnote{Gauge}
   	* wave equation for small vibrations
   	  :math:`\Box_c u(t,x)=0\rightarrow u_{tt}-c^2 u_{xx}=0`





Hyperbolic Geometric Description
==================================

.. admonition:: A Coincidence?
   :class: note

   Let's start from this coincidence.

   .. _special-relativity-velocity-addition:

   .. figure:: assets/special-relativity/specialRelativityVelocityAddition.png
      :align: center

      Addition of velocities

   Recall that in special relativity, velocity addition is

   .. math::
      v_S = \frac{u+v_O}{1+ \beta v/c},
      :label: eqn-velocity-transformation-1d

   where :math:`v_S` is the velocity measured in moving frame S, :math:`v_O` is the velocity measured in frame O. This :math:`\beta` is the factor :math:`u/c` where u is the velocity of the moving frame measure in frame O.

   At the same time, we have the following hyper trig relation.

   .. math::
      \tanh (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tanh \alpha + \tanh \beta}{1 + \tanh \alpha \tanh \beta}.

   Isn't this addition of angles the same as the velocity addition?


The algebra of relativity is mostly based on invariance of a new distance under a new rotation. Here we are not going to repeat the derivation of these transformations from the beginning, instead we would like to have a look at the really amazing part of this mathematical theory.


As shown in :numref:`special-relativity-velocity-addition`, we define quantities in two different frames, the frame O and frame S. The velocity of frame S measured in frame O is :math:`u`. Out of this velocity we define a quantity

.. math::
   \tanh \alpha_u = \frac{u}{c},

In fact, any velocity divided by speed of light should be a hyperbolic tangent,

.. math::
   \tanh \alpha_{v_x} = \frac{v_x}{c}.

With this definition of hyperbolic tangent, we notice that

.. math::
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} = \cosh\alpha_u.

Suppose we have an object moving with velocity :math:`v_S` in frame S. The velocity measured in frame O is the addition of the velocity of frame S itself and the velocity :math:`v_S`, except the addition rule is not the usual plus but the rule stated in Eq. (:eq:`eqn-velocity-transformation-1d`). We apply the definitions of the hyperbolic trig function,

.. math::
   \frac{v_{S}}{c} = \tanh(\alpha_u + \alpha_{v_O}) = \frac{\tanh \alpha_{u} + \tanh \alpha_{v_0}}{1 + \tanh \alpha_{U} \tanh \alpha_{v_O}} = \frac{u/c + v_O/c}{1+ \frac{u}{c} \frac{v_{O}}{c}}.

We could imagine the algebra of velocities would be simply summations if we define 'velocity' as :math:`\arctan \frac{v_x}{c}`.

Addition of velocities is not that fundamental. What's more important is :highlight-text:`the transformation of coordinate`, as we have always been talking about. In the old school language, the coordinate transformation is

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   t_O\\
   x_O
   \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \begin{pmatrix}
   1 &  u/c^2 \\
   u & 1
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   t_S\\
   x_S
   \end{pmatrix},

where

.. math::
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} = \cosh\alpha_u.

If we use the language of hyperbolic trig functions, this transformation becomes

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   t_O\\
   x_O
   \end{pmatrix} = &\cosh\alpha_u \begin{pmatrix}
   1 &  (\tanh \alpha_u)/c \\
   c(\tanh\alpha_u) & 1
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   t_S\\
   x_S
   \end{pmatrix}\\
   =& \begin{pmatrix}
   \cosh\alpha_u &  (\sin \alpha_u)/c \\
   c(\sin\alpha_u) & \cosh\alpha_u
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   t_S\\
   x_S
   \end{pmatrix}.

To make the transformation symmetric, we consider

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   c t_O\\
   x_O
   \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
   \cosh\alpha_u &  \sin \alpha_u \\
   \sin\alpha_u & \cosh\alpha_u
   \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
   ct_S\\
   x_S
   \end{pmatrix}.

.. admonition:: Natural Unit
   :class: hint

   Look at these tedious steps. Why not just use natural units and set :math:`c=1`. We should.

This is basically the rotation matrix in hyperbolic spacetime.

.. admonition:: Rotation in Euclidean Space
   :class: toggle

   The rotations in Euclidean space is described as

   .. math::
      \begin{pmatrix}
      x'\\
      y'
      \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
      \cos\theta &  -\sin \theta \\
      \sin\theta & \cos\theta
      \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
      x\\
      y
      \end{pmatrix}.

It is quite different from the rotations in Euclidean space.


Since we are talking about geometry, space-time diagram will be extremely important. The length contraction, time dilation, and even doppler shift can be explained and calculated using the hyperbolic trig functions. Triangles on the space-time diagram are described in :ref:`visualizations-of-hyperbolic-space`.


.. index:: time-dilation

Time Dilation
=========================

Use a spacetime diagram.


Length Contraction
=========================

Use a spacetime diagram.



.. index:: doppler-shift

Doppler Shift
=========================


The special relativistic doppler shift can be derived using the fact that 4-momentum is a vector thus it transforms under Lorentz transformation.


.. image:: assets/special-relativity/dopplerRedshift.png
   :align: center


The observer is fixed in O' frame and source is in O frame. Emitting angle in O frame is :math:`\theta`.

Since momentum is a vector, we have the Lorentz transformation which transfrom it in to O' frame,

.. math::
   \frac{E'}{c} = \gamma \left(\frac{E}{c} - \beta p_x\right),

where we also have

.. math::
   p_x &= p\cos\theta,\\
   p = E/c.

Combining these equations, the energy of the photons in O' frame is

.. math::
   E' = E \gamma (1 - \beta \cos\theta).

In quantum mechanics, energy is related to angular frequency,

.. math::
   E = \hbar \omega.

The angular frequency in O' frame is

.. math::
   \omega ' = \omega \gamma (1-\beta \cos\theta).

Redshift is define as

.. math::
   z &= \frac{\nu_e - \nu_o}{\nu_o} \\
   & = \frac{\omega_e - \omega_o}{\omega_o} \\
   & = \frac{1/\gamma - 1 + \beta\cos\theta}{1-\beta \cos\theta}.


.. admonition:: Non-relativistic Doppler Shift

   To understand the effect of relativity, we would first recall the non-relativistic doppler shift.

   .. math::
      \omega'_{non-rel} = \omega_{non-rel}(1-v/c \cos\theta).

   where no :math:`\gamma` is relavent. It's obvious that we have only two kinds of shift, redshift due to the source is closing, or blueshift due to the fact that the source is moving away.


Here we have three different kinds, the additional one is the transverse redshift due to the :math:`\gamma` factor or the contraction of time.


An gif from wikipedia shows this explicitly,

.. figure:: assets/special-relativity/XYCoordinates.gif
   :align: center

   Image Source: `File:XYCoordinates.gif <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:XYCoordinates.gif>`_


The change in wavelength is given by

.. math::
   \frac{\lambda_{obs} }{ \lambda_{src}  }= \sqrt{ \frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} } .


Relativistic Aberration of Light
==========================================

.. _relativistic-aberration:

.. figure:: assets/special-relativity/relativistic-aberration.png
   :align: center

   The relativistic aberration of light.

In astrophyics, object moving with a significant fraction of the speed of light :math:`v_S` with angle :math:`\theta` shown in :numref:`relativistic-aberration`, is measure from the observer in a direction

.. math::
   \cos \theta_O = \frac{\cos\theta_O - v_S}{1 - v_S \cos \theta_S}.

If the object is moving towards us, we observe :math:`\theta_O=0`.

Meanwhile the apparent transverse velocity is measured to be

.. math::
   v_{\perp,O} = \frac{v}{1-\beta \cos (\pi - \phi +\theta)},
   :label: eqn-relativistic-apparent-velocity

where :math:`\pi - \phi +\theta` is the angle between line of sight and the velocity, measured in the object's frame. One of the astonishing fact about Eq. (:eq:`eqn-relativistic-apparent-velocity`) is that it's maximun value can be larger than 1, which means we could observe superluminal objects.
